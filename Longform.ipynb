      "Millie Knight is a British Paralympic skier who competes in all five Alpine disciplines, from slalom to downhill. Each involves threading through gates, down an icy mountain course of drops and bends.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "Knight lost most of her sight in one eye at age 3, the other eye at 6. It never slowed down her skiing.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "Now at 22, Knight is one of the most decorated Paralympic skiers of the past decade — the winner of World Cups and world championships. She will compete in her third Paralympic Winter Games (which start on March 4), hoping to build on the success of 2018, where she and her sighted guide, Brett Wild, earned three medals.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "First, she has to get through her fear. Being visually impaired is one thing. Getting past the crashes that she never saw coming is another.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "Knight trails closely behind Wild down the mountain. He wears bright orange, and she tries to pick up the flicker of his movement. Mostly, she follows his verbal commands and the sound of his skis. Wild calls out instructions and warnings through Bluetooth headsets that they each have in their helmets.\n",

      "\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "“I ski with my ears,” Knight said.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "The scary part for Knight is being unable to see much of anything in front of her — the gates marking the course, a sharp turn, a patch of ice, a big drop in the terrain.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "“In a downhill, we potentially have jumps,” she said. “And so when you’re skiing along and suddenly the ground disappears from you, that can be quite scary.”\n",
      "Scroll text:\tIf Knight had full vision, this is what she would see going down a typical slalom run. Knight’s guide skis the course a bit wider and avoids the gates completely, so they don’t fling back and hit Knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scroll text:\tBecause of the scarring on her retinas, this is an approximation of what vision she has left. “The difficult thing to recreate is the way that I see through the gaps,” she said. Flecks of orange from her guide’s shirt seep through.\n",

      "Scroll text:\tBut her ears offer clues that her eyes cannot. Inside her helmet, it sounds like this. Wild gives fast instructions, some technical commands about skiing, some visual cues about what’s coming up. For example …\n",
      "\n",
      "Scroll text:\t… when you hear “load” and “roll,” those are signals for Knight to change the weight on her skis and to roll her ski edges over. Other commands like “hit the blue” refer specifically to hitting a blue slalom gate. Knight knows the tempo of the gates based on the cadence of Wild’s voice.\n",

      "Body text:\n",
      "“He can tell in my voice whether I’m scared or confident, by basically the sound of my breathing,” she said. “And if he can sense something’s not going particularly well, he will start screaming at me.”\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "Wild is a submariner for the Royal Navy, and he was released for the past few years to guide Knight. (He’s a former ski racer for Scotland.) Part of his job on the boat was to radio commands to the helmsman. Clear, confident, direct commands.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "“I was saying exactly what I had to say,” Wild said. “It can’t be messed up at all, because it was talking about the course of the submarine.”\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "He translated those skills into being a guide.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "“If I’m at all nervous or anxious, or a bit stuttery in what I’m saying, Millie’s not going to have the trust in me to turn the second I tell her to,” Wild said. “She needs to turn. She needs to believe what I’m saying and do exactly as I say, because my role is to get Millie down safely, then competitively.”\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "Wild said that they had never crashed on course, only after the finish line. But those accidents still rattle Knight. At the peak of her success, they tangled her relationship with fear.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "In 2017, Knight was skiing the downhill event at the world championships, feeling confident and steady. Going 115 kilometers per hour (more than 70 m.p.h.), she said, felt like going 10. Her inability to see helped hide the clues of danger.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "“And then at the end of that run, I failed to stop at the finish line and crashed into the crash barriers at that speed,” she said.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "She emerged bruised but not beaten. Four weeks later though, at a race in South Korea, she crashed again.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "“I did the exact same thing,” she said. “Came through the finish line very, very fast, tried to stop in one turn, flipped three times, landed on my head each time, dislocated my jaw. It was — it was really nasty.”\n",

      "It is off the race course, too. She fears cars passing nearby. She fears stepping off a curb into traffic. Confidence in her own navigational systems — a life of hearing, feeling, knowing without actually seeing — has been broken.\n",
      "Body text:\n",
      "And after so many years focused on becoming a faster skier, Knight has spent much of the past few years working on her mental approach, fixing the doubts and fears in her mind. There have been books, sports psychologists, hypnotists — all trying to get the old Millie back.\n",

      "“I feel like sometimes I’m being weak in letting that fear affect me as much as it does sometimes, which is then a whole host of other things that I need to worry about as well,” she said, “because I’ve got to stop the negative thoughts and the way that I sort of view myself.”\n",

      "It is worth noting here that a U.S. district judge, in a 2020 ruling dismissing slander accusations against Mr. Carlson, said Fox News’s lawyers argued persuasively that “any reasonable viewer ‘arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism’ about the statements he makes.” As you watch the videos in this story, consider the judge’s words. Mr. Carlson often begins segments with a grain of truth or an accurately quoted study, but then he distorts a concept to fit his narrative.\n",
      "theycare\n",
      "Here are all 1,150 “Tucker Carlson Tonight” episodes that The Times analyzed, from November 2016 through 2021. Mr. Carlson invoked the “ruling class” in more than <span class=\"yellowhighlight\">800 shows</span>.\n",
      "shutup\n",
      "Not only do <span class=\"g-text they\">they</span> want to control <span class=\"g-text you\">you</span>, Mr. Carlson warns, <span class=\"g-text they\">they</span> want to destroy <span class=\"g-text you\">you</span> and your way of life. <span class=\"g-text they\">They</span> have various ways of doing this, he asserts, including importing immigrants from the “third world” to replace <span class=\"g-text you\">you</span> with more “obedient voters.”\n",
      "This premise is the crux of an unfounded, racist conspiracy theory that falling birthrates and immigration are leading to the replacement of white people.<br><br>The theory echoes long-held beliefs of American white nationalists that a Jewish elite is orchestrating this replacement. (“Jews will not replace us,” was the chant of white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.) Versions of “replacement theory” have been cited by perpetrators of mass shootings, like those who targeted a Pittsburgh synagogue and Hispanic shoppers in El Paso.\n",
      "replace4_img\n",
      "Some of these segments begin with traditional conservative talking points about liberals being too weak on border security.

      "White nationalists celebrate Mr. Carlson’s message and success. “Does he actually believe in white nationalism?” asked R. Derek Black, a former white nationalist who has disavowed the movement. It doesn’t really matter, he said, because Mr. Carlson is using the same rhetoric. Having the most popular cable news host “directly pulling” from their talking points “makes them feel like, ‘Wow, we must be right,’” Mr. Black said.\n",
      "David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan (and Mr. Black’s godfather), tweeted in 2020 that Mr. Trump should choose Mr. Carlson as his running mate. Nick Fuentes, another white nationalist, cheered Mr. Carlson’s promotion of replacement theory.\n",
      "Andrew Anglin, the founder of the white nationalist website The Daily Stormer, has called Mr. Carlson “literally our greatest ally.” (The site features a countdown clock estimating when it says that white people will become the U.S. minority.) Mr. Carlson’s “replacement” message — and Mr. Carlson himself — has been used to promote a White Lives Matter rally.\n",
      "whitesup\n",
      "Mr. Carlson also uses rhetoric similar to that of men’s rights activists, nativists and others on the fringes of the right. “He is a linchpin, a central node, of these different discourses, a place where they can all converge,” said Jennifer Mercieca<strong>,</strong> a historian of American political rhetoric and a professor at Texas A&M University. “And he repackages them in a way that makes his audience more likely to accept them.”\n",
      "Since Mr. Trump left office, Mr. Carlson has become the ideological enforcer of conservative populism. He has used his megaphone to weaponize cultural issues, like critical race theory and transgender rights, that drive the conversation in school boards and state capitals. And he sometimes uses his perch to punish Republicans who contradict his narrative. After Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, called the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol a “violent terrorist attack,” he appeared on Mr. Carlson’s show to apologize.\n",
      "Over time, the show has evolved to become more potent and direct, an echo chamber of Mr. Carlson’s narrative. Where Mr. Carlson once regularly interviewed guests who disagreed with him, he has increasingly devoted less airtime to opposing views and more to talking directly to <span class=\"g-text you\">you</span> — through his ever-growing monologues.\n",
      "Fox News did not change the guest format simply because liberals refused to come on the show, as Mr. Carlson has complained. Scrutinizing ratings data, the network learned that its audience didn’t actually want to hear from the other side. “From my discussions with Fox News bookers, my takeaway is that they’ve made the judgment that they just don’t do debate segments anymore,” said Richard Goodstein, a Democratic lobbyist and campaign adviser who appeared more than 90 times on Mr. Carlson’s show until the summer of 2020.\n",
      "Mr. Carlson has said he thinks about the show in installments — giving his audience one chapter tonight, one tomorrow. Many of his chapters end up in the same place: with warnings that the country — and sometimes civilization itself — is falling apart because of policies enacted by the ruling class.\n",
      "destruct\n",
      "Mr. Carlson has warned of such dire outcomes in nearly <span class=\"yellowhighlight\">600 episodes</span>.\n",
      "In the span of this story, you have seen more than 100 clips from the show. Each clip is just a snippet from a longer segment. Over the years, the show has dedicated more segments to the most divisive issues. Mr. Carlson devoted five times as many hours to such topics in 2021 as he did in 2017, the first full year of the show, according to The Times’s analysis.\n",
      "In a statement, Justin Wells, the show’s senior executive producer, defended Mr. Carlson’s choice of topics and language: “Tucker Carlson programming embraces diversity of thought and presents various points of view in an industry where contrarian thought and the search for truth are often ignored. Stories in ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ broadcasts and ‘Tucker Carlson Originals’ documentaries undergo a rigorous editorial process. We’re also proud of our ongoing original reporting at a time when most in the media amplify only one point of view.”\n",
